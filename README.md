# Over-sampling-of-imbalanced-data-with-SMOTE-and-ADASYN
Imbalanced data commonly exist in real world, especially in anamoly-detection tasks. Handling imbalanced data is important to the tasks, otherwise the predictions are biased towards the majority class. SMOTE and ADASYN are useful over-sampling tools to fill data for minority classes.

The data for the "Poor" and "Good" classes are much less than the "Standard" class:

The predictions are biased towards the majority class:
